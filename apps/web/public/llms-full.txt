## What is EigenSwarm?

EigenSwarm is an autonomous market making platform built on Monad. It lets anyone deploy AI-powered trading agents — called **Eigens** — that provide liquidity and market making for tokens on nad.fun, Monad's leading token launchpad.

Each Eigen creates a **dedicated liquidity pool** for a specific token. The agent autonomously:

- Generates trading volume through strategic buy/sell execution
- Manages bid-ask spreads to maintain healthy order books
- Captures **100% of LP fees** from every trade and routes them to the user
- Adapts strategy based on market conditions (higher-tier agents use AI evaluation)

Unlike traditional market making bots that require manual configuration, Eigens are fully autonomous. You deploy one, deposit funds, and the agent handles everything.

## How It Works

### 1. Token Selection
Choose an existing nad.fun token or launch a new one directly through EigenSwarm.

### 2. Agent Deployment
Select an agent tier (Lite, Core, Pro, or Ultra) and deposit the minimum required funds. EigenSwarm creates a dedicated LP pool and deploys your Eigen.

### 3. Autonomous Market Making
The Eigen begins trading autonomously. It executes buy and sell orders to generate volume and maintain spreads. All LP fees from trades in the dedicated pool flow to you.

### 4. Fee Collection
100% of LP fees go to the user. EigenSwarm only charges a protocol fee on positive P&L (profit), not on the principal or total volume.

## Agent Tiers

EigenSwarm offers four agent classes, each designed for different scale and sophistication:

### Lite Agent
- **Minimum Deposit**: $50
- **Max Daily Volume**: $500
- **Protocol Fee**: 3% (on positive P&L only)

- **Best For**: Small tokens, testing the platform, low-budget market making

### Core Agent

## LP Fee Structure

On nad.fun, trading fees are normally split:
- 40% to the token creator
- 40% to the platform (nad.fun)
- 20% to the protocol

With EigenSwarm, your Eigen operates its own dedicated LP pool. **100% of the LP fees generated in that pool go to you.** This is fundamentally different from other market making solutions where fees are split with infrastructure providers.

EigenSwarm's revenue model is based on a protocol fee charged only on **positive P&L** — meaning you only pay when your agent is profitable.

## Blockchain & Infrastructure

### Monad
EigenSwarm runs on **Monad**, a high-performance EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain. Monad provides:
- High throughput for rapid trade execution
- Low transaction costs
- Full EVM compatibility (Solidity smart contracts)
- Sub-second finality

### nad.fun Integration
nad.fun is the leading token launchpad on Monad. EigenSwarm integrates directly with nad.fun to provide automated market making for tokens launched there. The integration enables:
- Direct token launch from EigenSwarm's interface
- Automatic LP pool creation on nad.fun
- Seamless fee routing

## Smart Contract Architecture

EigenSwarm uses on-chain smart contracts for:
- **LP Pool Management**: Each Eigen gets a dedicated pool with isolated funds
- **Fee Collection**: Automated fee routing to user wallets
- **Agent Registry**: On-chain record of all deployed Eigens and their configurations

All contracts are deployed on Monad and are EVM-compatible.

## Key Features

### Dedicated LP Pools
Every Eigen creates its own LP pool. This means your liquidity is never mixed with others, and all fees generated from trades in that pool are yours.

### 100% Fee Capture
Traditional LP positions on AMMs split fees. EigenSwarm's architecture gives you the full fee from every trade in your dedicated pool.

### AI-Powered Trading
Higher-tier agents (Pro and Ultra) use AI evaluation to:
- Assess market conditions in real-time
- Adjust spread width dynamically
- Optimize volume generation patterns
- Minimize adverse selection

### Autonomous Operation
Once deployed, Eigens run 24/7 without manual intervention. They handle:
- Order placement and cancellation
- Spread adjustment based on volatility
- Volume pacing to avoid market impact
- Fund management within the deposit

### Real-Time Monitoring
The EigenSwarm dashboard provides live metrics:
- Current P&L
- Total volume generated
- Fee income
- Agent status and health
- Trade history
