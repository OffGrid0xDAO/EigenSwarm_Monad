# EigenSwarm

> Autonomous market making agents on Monad. Deploy AI-powered Eigens that generate volume, manage spreads, and capture 100% of LP fees on nad.fun tokens.

## About

EigenSwarm is a protocol-grade market making infrastructure platform built on Monad. Users deploy autonomous AI agents (called "Eigens") that create dedicated liquidity pools for nad.fun tokens. Each agent autonomously executes trades to generate trading volume, manage bid-ask spreads, and route 100% of LP fees back to the user. The protocol only charges a fee on positive P&L.
